    Browse the viewsize.html file in its own browser
    window. And then browse the sendsize.html file in its
    own window.

    When the sendsize.html file is reloaded, resized, or
    if the mouse moves over it that data will be seen in
    the viewsize.html window.

    NOTE: The localStorage events will only work if both
    files are delivered from an actual server. The use of
    "file://" will not work.
